	<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
	<p>The product is an innovative technology incorporation designed to curb the spread of Corona virus in both the covid and post covid era. It is designed to be worn at a strategic position in the body which is the wrist, a positioning which enables the device to function at 100% efficiency. The product supervises the actions of the hands (the main spreader of the virus) and keeps a log of it, sensing hand movement and body temperature, indications given whenever the hands come close to the face or whenever the body temperature is above or below normal. These features possessed by the product enable both disease control units and personnel wearers, keep tab.</p>
 <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
 <p>SmartCare through Bluetooth wireless communication technology and array of collection of well engineered network of sensors is able to monitor the user's arms movement, monitor user's body temperature and also communicate with nearby devices of its kind, so as to ensure proper social distancing. Through the bluetooth technology we are able to as well connect SmartCare to our smart phones for a better usage experience.</p>
